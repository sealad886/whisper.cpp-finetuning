# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We support the latest `main` branch and tagged releases newer than 90 days. Older versions may not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. Email the maintainers at `security@your-org.example` with the subject line `whisper.cpp-finetuning security`.
2. Include:
   - A detailed description of the issue and potential impact.
   - Steps to reproduce and any proof-of-concept scripts.
   - A suggested mitigation, if you have one.
3. Please allow 5 business days for an initial response. We strive to provide a fix or mitigation timeline within 10 business days.

## Preferred Disclosure Process

- Do not create GitHub issues for vulnerabilities.
- We will coordinate a disclosure timeline with you. Once a fix is merged, we will publish a security advisory and credit the reporter (if desired).

## Dependencies

If the vulnerability originates in an upstream dependency, we will coordinate with the upstream maintainers before public disclosure.
